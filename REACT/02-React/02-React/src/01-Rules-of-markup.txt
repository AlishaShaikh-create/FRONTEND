Rules of markup in JSX 

Rule1:
Return the single root Element

Rule2:
Close all the tags

Rule3:
camelCase most of the things

 JavaScript reserved keywords cannot be used as html attribute so we need to use the alternative name for that
  

 ForEx:
 class is an reserved keyword in js so it cant be used as html attribute instead we can use className

<div className="xyz"></div>
