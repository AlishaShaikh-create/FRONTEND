States in React:

3 main thing in react:

1.components
2.props
3.States

What is STATES:
->   The states is  a build-in react object that is used to conatin data or information about the component .
-> A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes,its components re-render

--------------------------
COUNTER FILE:

 function Counter()
{
   let count=0;
   function incCount()
   {
    count+=1;
    console.log(count);
   }

   return (
    <div>                
        <h3> Count = {count}</h3>
        <button onClick={incCount}>Increase count</button>
    </div>
   )
}
export default Counter;

In the above code count value is getting increased the value is not getting shown up in the <h3> tag . you wont see in any changes in the UI

States help in re-rendering the Component
 
what does this actually mean:
  It means that the component will re-execute again  then the value will get changed

Before understanding Sates let us understand 

HOOKS:
-> we can use the hooks in the function only
-> They let you use state and other React feature without writing class

useState():
 useState is  a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component

const [state,setState] =useState(initialState)
                                     |--> initial state

useState return an array with exactly 2 values
1.current state . During the frist render, it will match the initialState you have passed.

2. (setState) set function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger 

-> The use state cannot be used directly we need to import it from the react

import {useState} from 'react';

Example of State:



import { useState } from 'react';
function App()
{
   let [count,setCount]=useState(0);
   let incCount=()=>{
    // count=count+1
    setCount(count+1); // this is not the right way of updating the value
    console.log(count);

   }

  return (
    <>
    <h1> States in React </h1>
    <h3> Count = {count}</h3>
    <button onClick={incCount}>Increase count</button>
   

    </>
  )
}
export default App;

-----------------------------------
useState hooks can be used inside the componet only
 we can create multiple state Event
