 REACT ?
 React is Js(JavaScript) Library for creating UI(User Interface)
 
What is UI?
UI stands for User Interface, referring to anything that allows a human to interact with a machine, software, or hardware device. It includes the visual elements, such as screens, buttons, and icons, as well as other aspects like sound and overall style, to create a smooth and effective interaction for the user

What is Component?
React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.
n React, a component is a self-contained, reusable building block of a user interface (UI). Components allow you to break down complex UIs into smaller, independent, and manageable pieces. They are the fundamental units for building React applications.

Everything in React is a component

What ever we write in react is an JSX Syntax?
what is JSX (JAVASCRIPT XML)
JSX is like a shortcut for writing UI in React. It stands for JavaScript XML, and it lets you write HTML-like code inside your JavaScript—so your code looks cleaner and easier to understand.

How does the JSX run in browse?
Babel is a JavaScript compiler. It takes your modern JavaScript code (like ES6+, JSX, or even TypeScript) and translates it into older JavaScript that all browsers can understand—even the outdated ones.
