//2025-08-04T08:36:38.192Z
// That's an example of an ISO 8601 timestampâ€”a standardized way of representing date and time. Here's how it breaks down:

// 2025-08-04 â†’ Date (Year-Month-Day)

// T â†’ Separator between date and time (short for "Time")

// 08:36:38.192 â†’ Time (Hours:Minutes:Seconds.Milliseconds)

// Z â†’ Stands for Zulu time, which is another name for UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)

// ðŸ“˜ This format is widely used in programming, APIs, databases, and international data exchange because it's unambiguous and sortable.

//UTC TIME FORMAT
// UTC stands for Coordinated Universal Time. It's the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.

// It's not a time zone, but a global time reference.

// Time zones around the world are defined by their offset from UTC (e.g., India Standard Time is UTC+5:30).

// UTC replaced GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) as the official standard, though GMT is still used informally.

// It doesnâ€™t change with daylight saving time, making it ideal for international coordination.
