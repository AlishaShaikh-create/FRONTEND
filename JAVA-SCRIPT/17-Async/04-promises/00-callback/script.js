//this is the situation of call back hell
//CALLBACK HELL:
//Callback Hell is a situation in JavaScript where multiple nested callback functions make your code look like itâ€™s been through a blender on the highest setting.
// This typically occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations, such as making API requests or handling file I/O, where one operation depends on the result of another or previous One.
