//DOM :DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL:
//The document object represents your web page.
// If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.

//HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).

//HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.
document.getElementById('first');//where first is the name of the id;

To apply changes in the html element we can access element by id
